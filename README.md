## AspectjGradlePlugin

This plugin based on the https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/aspectj.gradle plugin and will be updated to work with Gradle 5, because the existing plugin seems to be no longer maintained and failed to use with Gradle 5 due to a deprecated function in the new API.

More information and examples coming soon...
